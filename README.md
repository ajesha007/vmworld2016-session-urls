## Session View Statistics

One thing I had noticed on the VMworld site when watching a session is that it includes a "Views" count. I thought it would be cool to share some of the statistics on top views from our customers/partners and what sessions they found interesting. Below are the results for the Top 10 for all VMworld sessions as well as Top 10 for each category. I will periodically update the site with the latest snapshot of the data.
